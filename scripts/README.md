# Update Stats Script

This script automatically calculates Season Performance and Career Statistics from your tournament results data.

## Usage

Whenever you add new tournament results to `src/data/results.ts`, run:

```bash
npm run update-stats
```

## What It Does

The script will:
1. Read all tournament results from `src/data/results.ts`
2. Calculate statistics:
   - **Season Stats**: Events, Top 10s, Best Finish, Earnings for current year (2025)
   - **Career Stats**: Wins, Top 10s, Best Finish, Total Events, Career Earnings, Tours Played
3. Update `src/data/stats.ts` with the calculated values

## Output

The script displays calculated stats in the terminal before updating the file:

```
üìä Calculating statistics from results...

Season Stats (2025):
  Events: 24
  Top 10s: 1
  Best Finish: T8 (Pinnacle Bank Championship)
  Earnings: $115K

Career Stats:
  Wins: 1
  Top 10s: 8
  Best Finish: 1st
  Events: 102
  Earnings: $315K+
  Tours: 6

‚úÖ Successfully updated src/data/stats.ts
```

## When to Run

Run this script:
- ‚úÖ After adding new tournament results
- ‚úÖ After updating tournament earnings
- ‚úÖ When you want to verify stats are accurate

Don't need to run:
- ‚ùå During development (it doesn't auto-run)
- ‚ùå During builds (it's manual only for performance)

## How It Calculates

- **Top 10s**: Counts finishes of 10th or better (T10, 9, T8, etc.)
- **Wins**: Counts finishes of "1", "W", or "1st"
- **Earnings**: Sums all `earnings` fields, converts to K/M format
- **Tours**: Counts unique venue names across all results

## Notes

- The script uses `.mjs` extension to use ES modules
- It directly parses the TypeScript file (no compilation needed)
- Stats file is completely overwritten - don't manually edit it!
